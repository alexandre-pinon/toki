- At all point, follow apple's HIG (Human Interface Guidelines), this project is mainly meant for IOS, Android should still work decently but forget about material design guidelines.
- Prefer good naming over comments, use them only in case of complex logic or business rules
- Prefer types over interfaces
- Avoid casting using `as` at all cost

Commands

- If possible, prefer installing package using `pnpx expo install x`
